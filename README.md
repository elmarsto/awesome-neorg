## FAQ

### Wot's all this about? 

Neorg is an org-mode-alike for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

And if you're wondering what _that_ is about, then you're in for a treat :) [Check out Neovim awesomeness here.](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) 

### Who are you? 

Just a software engineer, helping out of personal interest.  

### What's your relation to the Neorg project? the Neovim Project? 

I'm basically a megafan of Neovim and most of its surrounding ecosystem, especially Neorg.

They said "be the change you want to see in the world," and I wanted to see more Neorg. Like, a *lot* more.
